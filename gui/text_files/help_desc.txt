[title] How to Run a Simulation

[subtitle]1. Create a new project.
- Click 'Project' -> 'New Project'. A new tab will appear with a map of the full Mars terrain.

[subtitle]2. Select a bounding box within the map to define an area of interest.
- Click on the map and hold the mouse button to drag a bounding box. Once the mouse is released, a confirmation and reset button will appear. 
- Click on the 'Confirm' button to zoom into the selected area. Click on the 'Reset' button to redefine the bounding box.

[subtitle]3. Add rover. 
- Once the map is zoomed in, an 'Add Rover' button will appear next to the 'Help' button in the header.
- Clicking on the button will display a popup window to instantiate a rover.

[subtitle]3.1 Customizing the rover.
- You can select between pre-made rovers or create a custom rover in the 'Rover Selection' section.
- Choosing an option from the drop-down list will display the associated information on the right side of the window.
- In the 'Algorithm Field' section, you can choose the algorithms used to compute your rover's path.
- For A* in particular, heuristics can be adjusted using sliders for the values, which will influence the path computation.

[subtitle]3.2 Selecting coordinates for the rover.
- The user must choose either ‘One Point’ or ‘Multiple Point’ for whether the rover wants to go to one destination or pass through multiple points on the map.
- A button then appears to select the coordinates on the map based on the selected option.
- Once clicked, the map reappears and the user can place the start and end markers. 

[subtitle]4. Display path.
- At this point, the rover's markers are visible on the map of Mars within the area of interest. 
- A button 'Display Path' will appear in the header. Once the button is clicked, the path will be calculated
using the chosen algorithms and displayed, going from the start point to the end point(s).
- If multiple algorithms are selected, that same number of algorithms is displayed, one being highlighted.
- The highlighted path has its information displayed on the side.

[title] Extra Features
[subtitle]1. Creating multiple projects.
- You can have up to 9 tabs open at the same time. The user should be able to switch between the tabs by clicking on the desired tab. 
- These tabs can only be created by clicking 'New Project'. 
- A tab can be deleted by clicking the red button.

[subtitle]2. Load, save, delete project
- You can save a project to the database to load it again later on. Click 'Project' -> 'Save Project' to save the current active project. 
- To load a saved project, create a new project and then click 'Project' -> 'Load Project'.
- A list of saved projects will appear if any exist, and the user will be able to select one and load it. It will display the state it was saved at. 
- To delete a project from the database, click 'Project' -> 'Delete Project'. 

[subtitle]3. Selecting between multiple rovers
- You can create many rovers within the same project for the same area of interest by adding a rover after one has already been created. 
- If there is more than one rover instantiated for a project,a 'Select Rover' dropdown will appear in the header, with the different rovers. 
- Choosing a rover will display its path markers on the map. Only one rover's paths can be displayed at a time for a given map.
